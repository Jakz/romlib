### RomLib

I wrote this framework to help in my development of applications to manage, organize, verify, browse game ROMs.

This necessity arose from the fact that I'm working on two separate projects which share most of data and management structures:

- [No-Intro-Tools](https://github.com/Jakz/no-intro-tools), which is CLI tool meant to organize, rename and merge rom sets.
- [Rom-Manager](https://github.com/Jakz/rom-manager), which is a generic GUI based tool still meant to organize and rename rom sets while also browsing data. This is where everything started and it's the most ambitious project of the two.

This library requires another library to be built which is a generic utility framework and can be found [here](https://github.com/Jakz/java-pix-lib).
